Write an algorithm or flowchart or pseudo code to do a linear search on a list.

Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one.
 Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till 
 the end of the data collection.
 
 ALGORHYTHM INSTRUCTIONS FOR A LINEAR SEARCH
 
 1. L = (Number of items in list)
	C = 1 
	X = (Item to be matched)
 2. IF (C > L) THEN GO TO 6
 3. R = (item at position C on list)
 4. IF R = X THEN GO TO 5
	ELSE C = C + 1
	GO TO 2
5.PRINT "Match Found at position C of the list" THEN GO TO 7
6.PRINT "Match not found" THEN GO TO 7
7. END
