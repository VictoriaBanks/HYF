Alfo
finite set of steps to solv any problem
cannot be an indefinite loop, loops are allowed

Requirements:
has set of inputs
finite no of steps
well defied instruction sets - each step is unique
effective - in correct direction

ALGORHITHM DEV PROCESS

1 obtain a description of promblem
2 analyse the problem
3 develop a high level algo
4 refine the algo by adding more detail
5 review the algo

PRACTICE - ALGO CALL A FREND ON THE PHONE

Consider:
If phone is busy
If there is no answer
If no voicemail

Steps

1) Dial friend's number
2) If friend does not answer AND Voicemail exists THEN leave voicemail, else hang up.  WAIT 5 minutes then go to step 1).
3) If number is busy 
4)
5)

ONE possible solution:

1) Pick up the phone
2) Press each digit of the phone number on the phone
3) If busy hang up wait 5 mins try again
4) If no answer leave a message then hang up (friend will then call back)
5) IF no ans machine hang up wait 2 hours then jump to step 2
6) Talk to friend
7) Hang up phone


ALGO IN COMPUTER WORLD

A computer program consist fo logival rules which it follows.  These are ago
Algo define how EXACTLY to operate to solve a problem
COmputer programs are only a bunch of algo slapped togther with a bunch of structured data
Algo plus data structure = Programs

WHY AN ALGORHITHM

Enables analysis of problem at hand
Acts as a blueprint for coding
Promotes effective communication between team members
assists in debugging
Becomes part of software documentation for future reference during maintenance phase.

HOW TO WRITE AN ALGO

Can be written in one of two forms

1) Plain set of step by step instructions
2) Flowchart
3) Pseudocode -

1) step by step instructions

An algo to check whether a nunber is postive or negative

1 take the number
2 read the number
3 if (number == 0) print "You entered 0" 
4 if (number is >0) print "You entered a positivenegative number" 
5 if (number is <0) print "You entered a negative number" 

TEST

Three numbers a b c and decide which one is bigger

1) Take a, b and c
2) Read a, b and c
3) If a is > b AND a is > c Then Print "a is the biggest number
4) If b is > a AND b is > c Then Print "b is the biggest number
5) If c is > b AND c is > a Then Print "c is the biggest number
6) IF a == b and a = c Then Print "All numbers are equal"
7) IF a == b BUT a =/= c AND a > c then Print " a nd b are equal and the biggest number" Else print "c is the biggest number"
8) IF a == c BUT a =/= b AND a > b then Print " a nd c are equal and the biggest number" Else print "b is the biggest number"
9) IF c == b BUT a =/= c AND c > a then Print " c nd b are equal and the biggest number" Else print "a is the biggest number"
10) END

START (Assuming that the numbers are all different)

1) Read abc
2) If a>b then go to 3 else 4
3) If a>c then max = a else max = c go to 6
4) If b>c then max b else max = c go to 6
5) Write max
6) Stop

2) FLOWCHART

A FC is a diagrammatic represenatation of an algo
FC use simple geometric shapes to depict processes and arrows to show relationships and data flow
Benefis
Simplicity  - v readable and easy to understand
Better communications and effectve analysis (computer knowledge note required)
Proper testing
Proper documentation

SYMBOLS

START/STOP Oval
PROCESS REctangle
INPUT/OUTPUT Slanted rectangle
Decision Diamond
Arrow

Eg for FC Postove and Negatic Algo

Oval - Start 
Arrow
Slanted Read N 
Arrow with f next to it
Diamond "Is n > 0" arrow to T slant "Print N is postive" arrow to just above STOP
Arrow with F next to it
Diamond "If n < 0" arrow to T "Print is negative" arrow to just above STOP
Arrow with F next to it
Print N is 0
Arrow to Stop
STOP

3 PSEUDOCODE

PSC is an artificial and informal lang that helps programmers dev algo
PC is writtne more close to programming lag
It contains motr prog details than structured english
It provide medthod to perform thr task as if th ecomputer is executing the  code
Manny prog pand des pref this way to state algo and prog specs

EG
Pseudo code for the algo to see if a number is positive or negative

Function numCHeck
Get value of n,
If(n==0)
    	Print "The number is zero"
Else if (n>0)
	Print "The number is positive"
Else if (n<0)
	Print "The number is negative"
